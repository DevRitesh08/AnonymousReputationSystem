# Anonymous Reputation System

## Project Description

The Anonymous Reputation System is a blockchain-based solution that enables users to build and verify reputation scores while maintaining complete privacy through cryptographic proofs and zero-knowledge commitments. This system allows participants to prove their reputation without revealing their identity or specific transaction history, creating a trustless environment for reputation-based interactions.

The system utilizes cryptographic commitments and hash-based proofs to ensure that reputation scores are authentic while keeping user identities completely anonymous. Users submit cryptographic commitments of their reputation data, which can later be verified and aggregated without exposing personal information.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a decentralized reputation infrastructure that solves the privacy-trust paradox in digital interactions. We aim to enable:

- **Privacy-First Reputation**: Allow users to build and leverage reputation without sacrificing personal privacy
- **Trustless Verification**: Enable reputation verification without relying on centralized authorities
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Create a universal reputation system that works across different platforms and services
- **Fraud Prevention**: Use cryptographic proofs to prevent reputation manipulation and gaming
- **Democratic Governance**: Implement community-driven reputation standards and thresholds

## Future Scope

## Usage Examples

### Submit Anonymous Reputation
```clarity
(contract-call? .anonymous-reputation submit-reputation-commitment
  0x1234567890abcdef... ;; commitment hash
  100                  ;; reputation score
  0xdeadbeef...       ;; cryptographic proof
)
```

### Verify Reputation Threshold
```clarity
(contract-call? .anonymous-reputation verify-and-aggregate-reputation
  (list 0x123... 0x456... 0x789...) ;; commitment hashes
  50                                 ;; verification threshold
)
```

## Security Considerations

- **Cryptographic Security**: All reputation commitments use SHA-256 hashing
- **Privacy Protection**: No personal identifiable information is stored on-chain
- **Proof Validation**: Comprehensive validation of cryptographic proofs
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamp-based protection against replay attacks
